About GeneSetPheno 
GeneSetPheno is a user-friendly graphical interface application designed to integrate, summarize, and visualize gene and variant-phenotype associations across gene sets. It integrates data from public databases such as the AstraZeneca PheWAS Portal (https://azphewas.com), FinnGen (https://r11.finngen.fi), GWAS Catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (https://hpo.jax.org), and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) (https://gtexportal.org) to generate visual summaries of gene, genetic variant, phenotype, and association information.
